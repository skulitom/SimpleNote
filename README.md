# SimpleNote App

**Clone and run to multiply your productivity and effectiveness**

SimpleNote was made with a busy person in mind. Do you identify with?:

- Tired of switching tabs to take notes
- Cannot take notes whilst reading
- Note taking takes too much effort
- Tired of complexity

SimpleNote allows you to make quick short notes at any time with a shortcut and a few keystrokes.
SimpleNote blocks the minimal amount of screen possible so that it does not obstruct your reading and attention. Remain focused on the task at hand and make quick simple notes.
